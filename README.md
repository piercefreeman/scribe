# scribe

Blogging system for my personal site, [freeman.vc](https://freeman.vc). Intended as a bare-bones and fast Python library that supports:

- Filesystem-based markdown notes
- Code & terminal syntax support
- Note lifecycle support; work on drafts concurrently with published notes
- Fast rebuilding of the full website payload
- Tailwind styling support
- Local development server

## Conventions

Raw markdown files are used as the dynamic blog entries of the site. These files drive their own customization - in order to do so we rely on some file conventions.

1. Posts are expected to begin with a header that determines the post title and its URL.
2. Posts include a `meta` yaml body that specify its properties. If you don't specify one manually, Scribe will add one at runtime for each markdown file in its tracked directory.
3. Images bundled with the post should live within the same folder as the parent post.

```
# Header

meta:
    date: February 2, 2022
    status: publish
    tags:
        - tag1
        - tag2

This post is the next best thing since the Apple I.
```

For full metadata schematic, see the `NoteMetadata` class.

**date**: Human readible date, parsed with the `python-dateutil` parser. This supports fuzzy parsing but I typically use a `Month Day, Year` convention.

**status**:  Articles are scratch drafts by default. This means they won't be published anywhere on the website at build time. Files without the `meta` are also considered scratch notes, so early works in progress won't be bundled. Documents set to `state: draft` will create a page that's only resolvable with its direct link. Draft pages won't be available in the global index that appears on the homepage. Add the `state: publish` metadata flag to consider it launched and therefore globally visible.

**tags**: List of tags that are tied to this page. These can be filtered in the jinja templates using the `filter_tag` function plugin.

**featured_photos**: Data structure to store images that don't appear in the page body but should be used in different elements of the site. Used currently for the travel photo gallary.

## Getting Started

To install:

```bash
uv sync
npm install
```

When writing, use the auto-refresh utility:

```bash
uv run scribe --notes public start-writing [--port]
```

If you'd like to build without the full CLI:

```bash
uv run scribe --notes public build
```

## ZSH Shortcuts

To make it easier to work with scribe, you can add the following to your `~/.zshrc`:

```zsh
# Scribe blog shortcut
scribe() {
    cd ~/projects/scribe && uv run scribe --notes ~/notes/public $@"
}
```

After adding this, reload your shell configuration with `source ~/.zshrc`. Then you can simply type:

```zsh
scribe start-writing
```

This will:
1. Navigate to your scribe directory
2. Install/update dependencies using uv
3. Start the writing server

You can also pass additional arguments like `--port` directly: `start-writing --port 8001`

## Styles

Default styles are generated by Tailwind, which is automatically launched when `start-writing` is invoked. To watch or regenerate the styles explicitly, run:

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./style.css -o ./scribe/resources/style.css --watch
```

Code highlighting is powered by pygmentize with the solarized-dark theme. These styles operate separately from tailwind. To generate, run:

```bash
pygmentize -S solarized-dark -f html -a .codehilite > ./scribe/resources/code.css
```
